I am a research fellow and an associate lecturer in the School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne. I obtained my B.Eng., M.Eng. and PhD degrees from Jilin University (China), Tsinghua University (China) and The University of Melbourne (2019). I have a broad interest in the theory and applications of machine learning and deep learning.


I work closely with <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/" target="_blank">Prof. James Bailey</a>.
I have also visited National Institute of Informatics, Japan hosted by <a href="http://research.nii.ac.jp/~meh/" target="_blank">Prof. Michael E. Houle</a>, and RIKEN, Japan hosted by <a href="https://bhanml.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Bo Han</a>, <a href="https://niug1984.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Gang Niu</a> and <a href="http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Masashi Sugiyama</a>. I was fortunate to have collabarated with <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/smonazam/" target="_blank">Prof. Sarah Erfani</a> (Melbourne University), <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/csyisenwang/" target="_blank">Dr. Yisen Wang</a> (Tsinghua University), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HUYTC0gAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Feng Lu</a> (Beihang University), <a href="http://www.crystal-boli.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Bo Li</a> (UIUC), <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~qgu/" target="_blank"> Prof. Quanquan Gu</a> (UCLA), <a href="http://www.yugangjiang.info" target="_blank"> Prof. Yu-Gang Jiang</a> (Fudan University), and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/" target="_blank">Prof. Dawn Song</a> (UC Berkeley).
