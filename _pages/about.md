I am currently a research fellow in the School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne. I obtained my PhD degree from the School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne. Prior to my PhD, I completed my master's and bachelor's degrees in Tsinghua University and Jilin University.
I have a broad interest in the theory and applications of machine learning and deep learning.

<!-- I have visited a few amazing research institues: National Institute of Informatics (Japan) hosted by Prof. Michael E. Houle, and RIKEN (Japan) hosted by Prof. Masashi Sugiyama. I am also fortunate to have collabarated with many highly respected researchers. -->
